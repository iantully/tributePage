First coding project completion via Code Academy
This was a really rough project. I found that I didn't enjoy coming up with the looks of the project nearly as much as actually developing the page itself. I also found that the teaching material provided by Free Code Academy didn't remotely prepare me for the skills necessary to complete this project.
