              <p>John F. Kennedy’s family lived in East Boston, off of Meridian Street. His grandfather having immigrated from Ireland, Kennedy was known to cite his heritage in Eastie often through his Senate career.</p>

<p>The landmass that is East Boston today was originally made up of five islands:
    <ol> 
        <li> Noddle's Island </li>
        <li> Hog's Island(which later known as Breed's Island, and would become Orient Heights) </li>
        <li> Governor's Island </li>
        <li> Bird Island </li>
        <li> Apple Island </li>
    </ol> It was annexed by Boston in 1836</p>
<p>Boston officials eventually formed what is present day East Boston with landfill, paving the way for industry to inhabit and utilize the land. 
Companies like The East Boston Company, the East Boston Lumber Company, and the Boston Sugar Refinery are credited with much of the development of East Boston. The need for workers to travel across the Boston Harbor garnered the necessity of efficient Harbor transportation. Once the Sumner Tunnel and Callahan Tunnel were completed in 1934 and 1961 respectively, East Boston became far more accessible and livable.</p>

<p>Eastie’s population has historically been incredibly diverse. First the Irish and the Canadian's in the 1900’s, followed historically by  the Russians, then Jews, Italians, Southeast Asians, and lastly, and most recently, Latinos. As of 2011, comprising an approximated 54% of the total 40k+ residents, Latinos are the largest race representing East Boston. Caucasians represent about 35%, with the remaining 11% consisting of Asian, black, African-American, and multiracial people.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Boston#Gentrification" target="_blank">Gentrification</a></h2>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Taking a walk through  East Boston, you’ll notice dilapidated apartments that might be missing windows (let alone the front door) neighboring condos whose paint is still drying, stacked to the 15th story with central AC and Harbor-facing patios. This contrast isn’t unusual either, being a product of the quickly escalating gentrification of Eastie. Rent hikes are pushing more and more East Boston Natives out of their homes, further north into Chelsea, sometimes seeing rent increases close to 40% year-over-year. Street protesting and landlord lawsuits are becoming more common, as tenants become desperate not to be push out of their communities.</p>
